        Biryani is a
        mixed rice dish, mainly
        popular in
        South
        Asia. It is made
        with rice, some type of meat and
        spices. To cater
        to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.
        Sometimes eggs and/or
        potatoes are also
        According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal
        Empire
        (1526â€“1857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian polao.[11] Indian restaurateur
        Kris
        Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals.[12] Salma Hossein,
        whom the
        BBC regards as the "doyenne of Islamic cooking in India", shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to
        India
        from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim,
        stating that
        it originated in Iran and that "there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Moguls. It is
        far
        more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in
        South
        India".[13]

        Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered
        India.[14] The
        16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that
        the
        word "biryani" is of older usage in India.[citation needed][15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India
        with
        Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native
        land during
        that</h3>
